# Expressive Web
Expressive Web is a free software to build static websites using WYSIWYG blocks.  
It is written in .NET using Avalonia UI, so it should work correctly on the following systems: Windows, Linux, MacOS.  
But note that it has only been tested on Windows 11 for the moment.  
If you plan to compile it for other systems, please check Avalonia UI docs: https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/deployment/

## History
Expressive Web was created to be a successor of PageFabric, a free WYSIWYG website builder for Windows only written in WPF.
