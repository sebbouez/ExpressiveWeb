# Web Expressive

Web Expressive is a free software to build static websites using blocks.  
It is written in .NET using Avalonia UI, so it should work correctly on the following systems: Windows, Linux, MacOS.  
But note that it has only been tested on Windows 11 for the moment.  
If you plan to compile it for other systems, please check Avalonia UI docs: https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/deployment/
